If you have a .then() block after a .catch() block, the behavior depends on whether the .catch() itself throws an error or returns a value. Let's explore both cases.

1️⃣ Case 1: .catch() Handles the Error and Returns a Value
If .catch() returns a value, then the .then() block after it will execute with that returned value.

let p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    reject("❌ Error occurred!");
})
.catch(error => {
    console.log("Caught:", error);
    return "Recovered from error"; // ✅ Returning a value
})
.then(result => {
    console.log("Then block:", result); // ✅ This will execute
});

🔹 Output:

Caught: ❌ Error occurred!
Then block: Recovered from error
✔ The error was caught and handled in .catch(), so the .then() after it runs successfully.

2️⃣ Case 2: .catch() Throws Another Error
If .catch() throws another error, the .then() block after it won't execute. Instead, you'd need another .catch() to handle it.

let p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    reject("❌ Initial error!");
})
.catch(error => {
    console.log("Caught:", error);
    throw "🔥 New error from catch"; // ❌ Throwing a new error
})
.then(result => {
    console.log("Then block:", result); // ❌ Won't execute
})
.catch(error => {
    console.log("Final catch:", error); // ✅ This will execute
});



🔹 Output:

Caught: ❌ Initial error!
Final catch: 🔥 New error from catch
✔ Since .catch() threw another error, the next .then() never executes, and instead, a second .catch() handles it.

3️⃣ Case 3: No .catch(), but .then() Handles Rejections
You can also handle errors inside .then() itself, using the second argument:


let p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    reject("❌ Error occurred!");
})
.then(
    result => console.log("Success:", result), 
    error => console.log("Handled in then:", error) // ✅ Handling error inside then
);

🔹 Output:

Handled in then: ❌ Error occurred!
✔ This works, but using .catch() is generally preferred for error handling.
